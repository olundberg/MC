Monte Carlo Simulation 3 State 3D Potts Model 12-Sized lattice


The program will generate data from temperature t = 0 to t = 3. The output in .csv-format stores the data as

Temperature - Energy - Specific heat - Magnetic Susceptibility - Binder Cumulant - Magnetization


The following settings using GCC to compile is recommended:
gcc -o MonteCarloProgram MonteCarloProgram.c -lm -Ofast


Use Octave/Matlab or something to plot.
